Liopleurodon, the "Smooth-Sided
Teeth," was a genus of marine
reptiles, specifically of short-
necked plesiosaurs called pliosaurs.
Liopleurodon's long skull was 
exactly one-fifth of its total 
length; therefore, the largest
known specimen, with a head length
of 126 centimeters, was gigantic at
over six meters long. Although this 
is certainly a large size, it stands 
in stark contrast to BBC's popular 
but erroneous depiction of it as a 
25-meter-long monster. Liopleurodon 
had four strong, paddle-like limbs 
that propelled it forward quickly, 
a feature that is common amongst
plesiosaurs. With the great 
acceleration provided by its
flippers and a keen sense of smell, 
liopleurodon may have been an
ambush predator.

With fossils found all across 
Europe, liopleurodon prowled the
waves of the middle to late
Jurassic island continent. As an 
apex predator, it struck fear into 
the hearts of any creature that may 
have crossed its path. It was a 
piscivore and a carnivore with its 
diet including giant Jurassic 
fishes, sharks, ichthyosaurs, and in
dire times, even other pliosaurs 
fell to its precarious appetite.
